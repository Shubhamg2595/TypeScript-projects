#                           Project-1 : Maps
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project we have created a simple typescript application display employee and company location on google Map using google map api.

We have created interfaces and integrated them with TS classes. we have also used Implements clause for the purpose of tight coupling between classes and Interfaces.
